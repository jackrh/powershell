emitted when a PS command completes. This makes it difficult for
a comint mode to determine when the command has completed.

;; Using powershell on emacs23, I get an error:
;;
;;    ansi-color-process-output: Marker does not point anywhere
;;
;; Here's what's happening.
;;
;; In order to be able to read the output from powershell, this shell
;; starts powershell.exe in "interactive mode", using the -i
;; option. This which has the curious side-effect of turning off the
;; prompt in powershell. Normally powershell will return its results,
;; then emit a prompt to indicate that it is ready for more input.  In
;; interactive mode it doesn't emit the prompt.  To work around this,
;; this code (powershell.el) sends an explicit `prompt` command after
;; sending any user-entered command to powershell. This tells powershell
;; to explicitly return the prompt, after the results of the prior
;; command. The prompt then shows up in the powershell buffer.  Lovely.
;;
;; But, `ansi-color-apply-on-region` gets called after every command
;; gets sent to powershell. It gets called with args `(begin end)`,
;; which are both markers. Turns out the very first time this fn is
;; called, the position for the begin marker is nil.
;;
;; `ansi-color-apply-on-region` calls `(goto-char begin)` (effectively),
;; and when the position on the marker is nil, the call errors with
;; "Marker does not point anywhere."
;;
;; The following advice suppresses the call to
;; `ansi-color-apply-on-region` when the begin marker points
;; nowhere.
